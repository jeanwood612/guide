## What is a Web3 Wallet?

Before diving into the OKX Web3 Wallet, itâ€™s important to understand what a Web3 wallet is. A Web3 wallet is a blockchain-based digital wallet that helps users authenticate their identity, store, and manage assets within the decentralized Web3 network. Unlike traditional Web2 wallets, Web3 wallets not only store cryptocurrencies but also enable users to interact with decentralized applications (DApps), execute smart contracts, and participate in DAO governance.

### Core Features of Web3 Wallets:

- **Decentralization:** Web3 wallets are decentralized, meaning they donâ€™t rely on third-party platforms or institutions for management. Users have full control over their private keys and assets.
- **Multi-functionality:** Beyond basic wallet functions, Web3 wallets connect with DApps, support cross-chain operations, NFT trading, DeFi applications, and more.
- **Privacy Protection:** Web3 wallets use private key encryption to ensure user privacy. User identity and asset information are not exposed to centralized institutions.
