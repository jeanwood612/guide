## 1. Three Steps to Buy Bitcoin

### Step 1: Open the Purchase Page

Open the OKX App (download guide), and on the homepage, click **"Buy Crypto"** > **"Quick Buy Crypto"** to access the buying page. New users can also click **"Buy or Deposit"** on the homepage and choose to buy crypto to proceed.

### Step 2: Choose the Amount and Payment Method

Select the cryptocurrency you want to purchase (**BTC**). If itâ€™s not visible, use the search bar to locate it. Enter the desired **amount or quantity**, then click **"Select Payment Method"**.  

- Use the **up-down arrow toggle** next to the amount to switch between currencies or amounts.

### Step 3: Make the Payment

Choose your preferred payment method (e.g., bank card), click **"Next"**, and confirm your order details. The page will display the sellerâ€™s payment information for you to proceed with the transfer.

After transferring the payment offline, click **"I Have Transferred"**, then wait for the seller to confirm receipt of the payment.
