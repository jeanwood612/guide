## 1. What is NFT?

NFT, short for Non-Fungible Token, is a type of digital asset that is unique, indivisible, and irreplaceable.

### Key Characteristics of NFTs:
- **Non-Fungible:** Unlike fungible tokens such as Bitcoin, NFTs are one of a kind and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.
- **Indivisible:** NFTs cannot be split into smaller units like traditional cryptocurrencies.
- **Ownership on Blockchain:** NFTs provide a way to prove ownership of digital assets like game items, digital artwork, and tickets, outside centralized services or databases.

### How Do NFTs Work?
NFTs are minted on blockchains, making them unique and immutable. For example:
- **CryptoPunks (2017):** A project featuring 10,000 24Ã—24 pixelated characters on Ethereum.
- **CryptoKitties (2017):** A blockchain game that popularized NFTs through digital cat trading.

Since then, NFT applications have expanded from gaming to collectibles, art, domain names, and digital identities, with art, DeFi, and gaming driving various waves of NFT adoption.
