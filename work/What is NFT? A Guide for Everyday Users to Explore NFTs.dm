## What is NFT?

NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token, a type of unique digital asset that is indivisible, irreplaceable, and one-of-a-kind. Unlike fungible tokens such as Bitcoin, where each unit holds the same value and is interchangeable, NFTs represent ownership of a distinct item or piece of content. 

### Key Characteristics of NFTs:
- **Unique:** No two NFTs are the same, giving each asset its intrinsic value.
- **Indivisible:** Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be divided into smaller units.
- **Blockchain-Based:** NFTs are stored on a blockchain, ensuring authenticity and ownership.

### Early History of NFTs
The origins of NFTs date back to 2017 with the Ethereum-based project **CryptoPunks**, which featured 10,000 unique 24x24 pixel art characters. Shortly after, **CryptoKitties**â€”a blockchain game allowing users to trade virtual catsâ€”propelled NFTs into mainstream attention. Since then, NFTs have expanded beyond gaming into art, collectibles, domain names, and even DeFi ecosystems.

## How to Participate in NFTs?

For ordinary users, there are three main ways to engage with NFTs:

### 1. **Buy NFTs**
You can directly purchase NFTs from primary or secondary markets, including:
- **Primary Markets:** Participate in auctions for new digital art, collectibles, or gaming assets.
- **Secondary Markets:** Explore platforms like OpenSea to trade existing NFTs.

Before purchasing, ensure you have:
- A **digital wallet** (such as OKX Wallet) to store your NFTs.
- The necessary cryptocurrency (e.g., ETH for Ethereum-based assets).
- An account on an NFT marketplace.

**Tip:** When investing in NFTs, evaluate the assetâ€™s blockchain foundation, rarity, and potential market demand.

### 2. **Invest in NFT-Related Tokens**
NFT ecosystems often have native tokens used for governance or functionality. Some popular tokens include:
- **GameFi Tokens:** Powering NFT-based games and virtual lands.
- **Infrastructure Tokens:** Supporting blockchains like Ethereum that host NFT projects.

Currently, over 100 NFT-related tokens exist, with a combined market cap exceeding $24.8 billion according to CoinGecko. You can trade popular NFT-related tokens directly on OKX.

- **Visual Files:** JPG, PNG, GIF.
- **Music Files:** MP3.
- **3D Models:** GLB.

Steps to mint NFTs:
1. Prepare your digital asset.
2. Connect your wallet to a minting platform.
