## Trusting OKX: Security and Reputation

While OKX has built a reputation for operational integrity, it's essential to recognize the inherent risks in the crypto space.

Despite these incidents, OKX has strengthened its security protocols to ensure user protection.

To minimize risks, itâ€™s recommended to store cryptocurrencies in offline wallets (cold wallets) for added security. This approach reduces exposure to online threats, giving you peace of mind when managing your digital assets.
